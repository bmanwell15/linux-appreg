## Description
This command-line utility enables you to register both single-file executables (for example, AppImage bundles or standalone binaries) and entire application directories with the KDE Plasma application menu. By moving the target file or folder into the user's ~/Applications directory and generating a desktop entry file, it makes your custom applications immediately visible and launchable from the KDE "Start" menu. Although it was developed and tested on Kubuntu, it should work on any Linux distribution running the KDE Plasma desktopâ€”such as KDE Neon, openSUSE KDE Plasma, Fedora KDE Spin, Arch Linux with KDE, and Linux Mint KDE Edition.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE SUDO FOR THIS COMMAND!
