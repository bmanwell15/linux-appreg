# Application Registration Program for Kubuntu KDE

## Description
This command-line utility enables you to register both single-file executables (for example, AppImage bundles or standalone binaries) and entire application directories with the KDE Plasma application menu. By moving the target file or folder into the user's ~/Applications directory and generating a desktop entry file, it makes your custom applications immediately visible and launchable from the KDE "Start" menu. Although it was developed and tested on Kubuntu, it should work on any Linux distribution running the KDE Plasma desktopâ€”such as KDE Neon, openSUSE KDE Plasma, Fedora KDE Spin, Arch Linux with KDE, and Linux Mint KDE Edition.

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE SUDO FOR THIS COMMAND!**

## Examples

```bash
# Register a basic .AppImage. Note the icon file is not automatically extracted.
appreg register ~/Downloads/MyApp_x86_64.AppImage -n MyApp -i MyAppIcon.png
```

```bash
# Registers a folder as an application, with main.sh being the entering file.
appreg register ~/Downloads/MyDirApp -n DirApp -i dirApp.png -e main.sh
```

```bash
# Lists all applications registered with this command. Useful for finding the name of the app, which is needed to remove the application.

appreg remove MyApp
```
